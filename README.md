# Comvex Frontend Assessment

The goal of this assessment is to learn about an applicant's approach to building re-usable components. Please be ready to talk about the technical and design choices you made.

## Movie Search Component

The task is to build a component (widget) that displays movies, TV shows, and people using the [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) API.

**Please write your code as you would in a professional environment (ready to be submitted for a PR).**

| Movie Tab                                            | People Tab                                           |

Please check our [InVision Assessment Project](https://invis.io/TWTATYNZ9XC) to have a clear view of what the component should look like.

> The password to access the project will be sent to you separately.

You can use InVision's `Inspect` feature to get more details about the UI integration (see the `</>` icon on the bottom right of the screen). This feature requires to be logged in to InVision (creating an account is free).

### Minimum Requirements

- The component should be able to search movies, TV shows, & people. **The results should only be relevant to the current tab** (e.g. if you are on the movie tab only movies are displayed).
- Please match the original design as closely as possible. Any extra UI elements must maintain the original design language.
- Deliver your code via a public repository or online code platform (GitHub, BitBucket, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, etc...).
- Provide a `README.md` file with an explanation on how to install & run your project.

### Optional Features

- Updating the URL with search term
- Dedicated entry points for the tabs (remember this is not a page but a component and the component should be able to be dropped into any site/app)
- Multiple thumbnails
- Inline movie trailer
- Search as you type
- Sensible animations/transitions
- Infinite scroll/pagination
- Lazy loading images
- Truncating long descriptions/bios
- Tests

**Important**: Before adding any extra features, please make sure you completed the minimum requirements. We would rather just see them properly done than half finished features. Either way you will be asked your thoughts on implementing the optional features.

### Technology Requirements

Use any library/framework you feel comfortable with. However, the position requires professional level ability with React.

### Hints

- There are [multiple endpoints for searching](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/multi-search)

## Deadline

There is no hard deadline but try and submit your work within 10 days. If you need more time please let us know by sending an email.
